// What a stage lets you do: its own work, and the step into the next stage.
//
// The API still keeps each stage separate so every result is traceable. The
// input-stage shortcut may chain structure -> map in the page, because a user
// asking to structure new material expects the storyboard to update as well.
//
// **What can be pressed, and what is said when it cannot, is decided in
// [lib/pipeline/stage-actions.ts](../../lib/pipeline/stage-actions.ts)** (tested
// there). This file only draws it. The decision left this component because one
// of its rules was wrong in a way no screenshot shows: "no material yet"
// disabled every button, including the film step, which does not read material.
//
// Running everything at once still belongs outside the flow, as a single
// control over the whole pipeline (the "動画を作り直す" button).
