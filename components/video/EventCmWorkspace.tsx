// The list below the player is not a completeness score. It answers the one
// question a user has when a finished film appears out of nothing — "where did
// all this come from?" — by showing each field's origin (§17.5). A proposal
// the tool made is labelled as one, so nobody publishes a guessed date
// believing somebody typed it.

// TWO BRIEFS, on purpose. `brief` is the workbench — the storyboard, the fact
// list and every edit act on it. `playing` is the film a run fixed, and it is
// the only thing the player runs. They disagree while somebody is working, and
// the notice between them says by how much rather than hiding it
// (docs/old/event-cm-refactor-plan.md §9.5).
