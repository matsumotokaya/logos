// Its own file because every narrated template needs it — product-cm and the
// narrated event promo today — and the brief schemas that use it are imported
// by the module that collects them. Passthrough because the track is written
// by the voice stage, not by a user: validation here is a guard against a
// truncated write, not a contract negotiation.
