// How this template sounds its structure — the audio sibling of delivery.ts.
//
// delivery.ts is the template's opinion about how its words are READ; this is
// its opinion about which moments RING. Same register, same justification: an
// event announcement marks its own structure — it begins, its title lands, its
// chapters turn, its speakers arrive, its close arrives — and marks nothing
// else. "やりすぎるとチープ" was the client's one-line brief for this layer,
// so two scenes are deliberately silent: the promise (fourteen seconds that
// want to be watched, not punctuated) and the end card (the film closes on
// music alone; a hit there reads as a stinger from another genre).
//
// **`presence` is not a volume.** The pool's files are mastered 10 dB apart,
// so a hand-picked volume per cue encodes the sample-maker's mastering as if
// it were a decision — measured on the Freehand Lab's first cut, where the
// opening clap arrived quieter than the chapter turns it outranks and the
// speakers' bell did not survive the narration at all (+25 RMS against +887).
// Each file is measured once at ingest (scripts/fetch-default-sfx.mjs →
// public/defaults/sfx/catalog.json, first-second mean → gain to −20 dB); the
// cue sheet only says how far forward a moment steps relative to the others.
//
// Levelling gets a file into range; it does not equalise instruments. A bell
// is diffuse where a woodblock is a transient, so 鈴 carries a higher presence
// than its role alone would suggest (measured: at equal presence it arrived at
// a third of every other cue's energy).
