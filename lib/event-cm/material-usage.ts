// docs/asset-normalization.md §9.1. The inventory answers 「何を持っているか」
// and the storyboard answers 「どこに載るか」; this is the one line of the
// inventory that reaches across, because a file nobody can place is the same

//
// The brief is the source, not take_inputs.role: 27 of the 47 pins say
// `brief_source`, which records that somebody uploaded a document to be read,
// not that the film shows it anywhere. Holding the pointer is what being used
// means, so the pointer's PATH is the answer, translated here into the scene
// names the storyboard already prints (EVENT_CM_SCENE_LABELS is the one place
// that owns those words).
//
// A mark legitimately comes back three times — it really is on screen three
// times — so this returns a list, not a slot.
