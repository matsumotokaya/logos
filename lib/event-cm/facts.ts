// mean reading one screen and typing into another; here the thing that says
// "this date is a guess" is the thing you correct it in.
//
// The stance is different from a document that must not be wrong. This fills
// everything in confidently and then admits, in the open, which parts it made
// up — because the user is passive: they react to what appeared, they do not
// brief it. So there is no "XXX", and there is no empty state to stare at.
//
// Three operations, and no others:
//   edit      replace the value. Origin becomes `user` and no re-run overwrites it.
//   suppress  keep the field but take it off screen. A DECISION, not a gap.
//   restore   undo a suppression.
