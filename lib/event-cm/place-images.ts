// Stage ④, second half: putting the pictures into the film.
//
// The model said what each image IS (structure.ts). Nothing here asks it where
// the picture should go, because that is not a reading problem: the film has
// three kinds of picture slot and a fixed order of preference between them, and
// a rule can be read, argued with and tested. A model choosing slots would give
// a different answer to the same material twice.
//
// Three commitments, in order of how much damage breaking them does:
//
//   1. **A face is never named by its face.** A portrait is attached to a
//      speaker only when something written down — a caption, the document, the
//      filename — gave that name. Otherwise the picture stays unused and says
//      so. Guessing here does not produce a wrong photo; it produces a wrong
//      person in a public announcement.
//   2. **Nothing a person decided is touched.** A slot they filled, or took off
//      screen, is left exactly as it is.
//   3. **A picture is never quietly dropped.** Every image the model judged
//      comes back either placed or listed as unused with the reason.
