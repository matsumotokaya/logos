// What the player is showing, and what the workbench holds that it is not.
//
// The storyboard edits `brief`. The player, the MP4 renderer and the public URL
// read `baked_brief` — the copy a run fixed (migration 0050,
// docs/old/event-cm-refactor-plan.md §9.5). So the two disagree by design, and the
// screen's job is to say by how much rather than to hide it.
//
// This module is the only place that answers "how much", and it answers it
// FIELD BY FIELD (docs/video-state-model.md §3.2). Every surface reads the same
// list — the pipeline's badge, the one button's count, the notice under the
// player, the chips in the fact list — because a badge saying 2 over a notice
// saying nothing is how the last round of bugs started.
//
// Compared on the STORED form of the two briefs, which is what makes a field
// comparison possible at all: stored, a photograph is `material:<uuid>` and
// stays that string forever. The client's copy has those pointers replaced by
// signed URLs that are re-minted on every load, so comparing THAT would report
// a change on a page refresh. Hence the rule this module depends on: it is
// called by API routes, never by the browser (§3.3).
//
// It used to compare three timestamps instead. That could not name what had
// changed, and worse, one of the three (`factsUpdatedAt`) deliberately ignores
// music, photographs and logos — so replacing the BGM moved nothing, the badge
// read 0, and the player went on playing the old track with no way to tell.
