// How much room a model call is given, and what to say when it runs out.
//
// One place, because the number is a policy rather than a per-call opinion.
//
// WHAT THE BUDGET COVERS: `max_completion_tokens` caps the COMPLETION —
// reasoning plus the answer — and not the prompt. A call can read a hundred
// thousand tokens of flyers under a budget of thirty thousand; what it may not
// do is think and write more than thirty thousand. On a reasoning model most
// of a budget goes to the thinking, which is why these numbers are far larger
// than the answers they carry (a scenario measures ~2,400, a Brand Kit ~4,000).
//
// WHY IT IS CAPPED AT ALL: a ceiling is not a reservation — nothing is billed
// for room left unused — so a generous limit costs nothing on an ordinary run.
// It costs on a pathological one: a model that starts repeating itself will
// spend every token it is allowed. The cap is what stops one confused call from
// running up a bill, so it stays finite.
//
// WHY THEY ARE THIS LARGE: the first version of the scenario call allowed 4,000
// against a typical spend of 2,352. That is not a limit that fails — it is one
// that fails SOMETIMES, which is worse, because a stage that usually works and
// occasionally dies of an English sentence about a length limit reads as
// corrupted data rather than as an exceeded size.

 * reads like a broken tool rather than a job that outgrew its budget. The guess
