/**
 * The five-stage pipeline for one V2 video Take.
 *
 * The same five stages as the brand-asset pipeline (deliverable-architecture
 * §15.2), but the inputs and outputs are read from rows the video product
 * already has — `takes` (brief), `take_renders` (status), `render_artifacts`
 * (MP4). Nothing here is stored: each stage is a read of its inputs and
 * outputs, so it cannot drift.
 *
 * Stage definitions stay close to the brand-asset ones (lib/pipeline/brand-
 * assets.ts). The point of staging is to give the user one mental model
 * across surfaces; if the video pipeline quietly renamed "map" to "render"
 * the metaphor would stop paying off.
