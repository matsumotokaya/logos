// What a pipeline drawer lets you press, and what it says when it does not.
//
// The same shape as lib/brand-tree-actions.ts and lib/event-cm/panel-actions.ts:
// the decision is data, tested here, and the component only draws it. A button
// that is disabled for the wrong reason is invisible in a screenshot and obvious
// in a test — and this file exists because one of them was: `disabled` meant
// "no material has been added", which is a real reason not to read anything and
// no reason at all not to write a narration. A freshly seeded video has no
// documents by design (§9.9), so the film step has to stay pressable.
//
// Two buttons per drawer, at most:
//   own      the work this stage does in place, while it has something new
//   advance  the step OUT of this stage, which runs the next stage's work and
//            opens its drawer — so progress appears where the work happens
//
// The chain is input → structure → map → film. The last link is not a stage of
// `run/[stage]`: it is the narration, the reading aloud and the fixing, three
// endpoints the page owns. So `run: "film"` hands the work back to the page and
// this file only decides whether there is any (§9.6).
