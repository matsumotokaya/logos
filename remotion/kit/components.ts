// The component vocabulary — what a scene can be made of.
//
// This is the layer that decides what is FIXED and what is FREE, and that line
// is the whole design:
//
//   FIXED  the set of components, their parameters, what each one does when it
//          has nothing to show, and how much text each can carry legibly.
//   FREE   which components a scene uses, how they are arranged, what they
//          say, and which one is loudest. That is where an LLM works, and it
//          is why the output is not obviously systematic.
//
// Getting the grain right matters more than the list itself. Atoms (text, box,
// image) make every combination possible and every result average. Whole
// finished scenes make quality high and coverage nil. These sit in between:
// each one is a thing a commercial video actually contains — a person, a
// programme list, a date — with the typography judgment already inside it.
//
// Rendering lives in remotion/kit/render/*; this file is the contract, so it
// stays free of React and can be reasoned about (and tested) on its own.
