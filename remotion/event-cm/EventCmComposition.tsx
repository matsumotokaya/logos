// The narrated event promo.
//
// Built entirely from the component kit (remotion/kit): the scenes are
// arrangements of vocabulary components, painted by a theme that the brand's
// own palette and typography feed into. Nothing in this file positions
// anything or picks a font.
//
// This replaces the previous version, which sequenced event-promo's
// hand-composed scene components. Those were good, and their judgments were
// kept — they live in the kit's components now, where a second template can
// reach them and a brand's values can change them.
//
// The spine is still the narration: scene order comes from the narration's roles
// and scene length from the timeline, which sharpens from budget to narration to
// measured voice (timeline.ts).

   * NEVER RETURNS ZERO while the film is running. A volume of 0 is not a quiet
   * moment to @remotion/media, it is a mute instruction —
   * `effectiveMuted = muted || mediaMuted || userPreferredVolume <= 0` — and

   * from one press of play to the next: 「1回目に再生した時が大きかったけど2回目

   * cues — which carry plain numbers and are never muted — left standing over
