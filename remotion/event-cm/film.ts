// The film, derived once.
//
// "What film does this brief make?" used to be answered by hand in several
// places — the composition, the storyboard, the narration API, the voice API —
// each walking its own subset of the same six steps (suppression → plan →
// timeline → scenes → fit → captions). Every bug in the 2026-08-14 session had
// the same shape: one consumer skipped a step the others took, and the film
// and its description disagreed (docs/old/event-cm-refactor-plan.md §1–2).
//
// This module is the answer said once. The composition sequences
// `film.scenes`; the storyboard re-says them in human words; the narration and
// voice APIs read `film.scenes.filter((scene) => scene.narrated)`. None of
// them derive anything about the film themselves.
//
// Deliberately not a React module: the same function runs in the Player, the
// CLI renderer, API routes and tests.
