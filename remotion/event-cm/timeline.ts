//   nothing written   → the scene budget (types.ts eventCmSceneBudget)
//   narration written  → the characters actually written, at reading pace
//   voice recorded    → the measured track, which is the truth
//
// This is why a seeded take can be handed over as a finished film with no LLM
// call and no render: "add a video" produces something that plays. Writing the
// narration changes the timing; speaking it changes it again. Nothing along
// the way is a placeholder frame or a spinner.
