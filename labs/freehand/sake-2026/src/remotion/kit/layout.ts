// How a scene arranges what it holds.
//
// A finite list on purpose. This is the layer that keeps output from looking
// systematic OR looking random: the arrangements are the ones commercial
// announcement video actually uses, so choosing among them is a real choice
// with no bad options — unlike a free canvas, where most placements are wrong,
// and unlike one fixed composition, where every film is the same film.
//
// An LLM picks the arrangement and the order of components. It never picks
// coordinates. Everything below resolves to flex, so a dropped or empty
// component closes the layout up instead of leaving a hole.
