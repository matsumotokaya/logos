// The subtitle band.
//
// Always drawn, never a scene's decision: most people watch this kind of film
// with the sound off, so a film whose words exist only as audio says nothing
// to them. It sits above every scene and below nothing.
//
// The default backdrop is a solid plate rather than a gradient. A gradient is
// prettier and cannot be trusted: a subtitle lands on photography, on gold
// rules, and on the scene's own typography, and blending with all of them is
// not possible. A plate says plainly that the subtitle is a separate layer —
// which reads better than a line that has half-disappeared into a picture.
