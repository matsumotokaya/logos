// Narrated event promo — the data contract.
//
// Same subject as `event-promo`, opposite spine. event-promo is a fixed 30s
// timeline (remotion/event/palette.ts EVENT_SCENES) that BGM and typography
// carry alone. Here the narration is written first and its timing decides the
// film: scene order comes from the narration's roles, scene length from the TTS
// track, exactly as product-cm does (remotion/cm/CmComposition.tsx).
//
// The art direction does not change — ink black × gold × mincho, the treatment
// proven by 世界が恋する日本酒.
//
// The brief USED to be `extends EventBrief`, which was convenient and wrong: it
// gave event-cm three fields no event-cm scene draws (`sideCopy`,
// `visuals.inkArt`, `visuals.texture` — event-promo's), and they surfaced in the
// goal and the fact list as things a user was invited to manage. Nothing on
// screen would ever change. So the two templates now share the VALUE types
// (a photo is a photo, a logo is a logo) and not each other's field lists.
//
// Facts are still never invented (docs/deliverable-architecture.md §17.2): the
// narration may only speak what the brief already knows. A null venue is not
// narrated as "会場は後日発表" — it is simply not said.

 * The film, scene by scene, always in this order.
 *
 * One message per picture, and one line of narration per picture. That single
 * rule is what the earlier version got wrong: `program` produced two pictures
 * from one line, so a sentence ran across a cut and the storyboard and the film
 * disagreed about how many times the screen changes. A presentation does not
 * put one message on two slides, and neither should this.
 *
 * The film opens and closes on the presenter's mark. Those two are silent: the
 * opening exists so the viewer knows whose film this is before anyone speaks,
 * and the close exists so they remember. Everything between them is narrated,
 * and the narration begins with the title call — an announcement names itself
 * first, rather than teasing and then explaining what was being teased.
 *
 * product-cm's roles are a sales argument (hook → problem → solution →
 * features → cta). An announcement is not an argument: nobody has a problem
 * that an event solves. It says whose it is, what it is, why it is worth an
 * evening, what happens, who speaks, and when.

 * film consists of, and everything that walks the film had to keep asking which
 * one won. That disagreement is exactly what `narrationStaleness` had to report
 * as `shape`, and what made a warning nobody could clear.
