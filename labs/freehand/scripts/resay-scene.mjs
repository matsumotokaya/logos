// Re-say ONE scene, and leave the rest of the recording untouched.
//
// The client changed a single word in scene 2 ("価値をアップデート" →
// "価値を深めて"). Regenerating the whole narration would be one call to
// generateVoice(), but it would also re-read every other scene — and those
// readings are approved, including 「〆張鶴」 which the model happens to voice
// correctly as しめはりつる. A reading that already passed review is an asset;
// paying TTS to roll the dice on it again is a regression waiting to happen.
//
// So: decode the existing WAV, cut it at the section boundaries the track
// already records, synthesize only the scene that changed, and re-mix. Because
// mixEpisode() with bgm=null does nothing but add sections into silence — no
// normalisation, no envelope, no fade — every sample of every other scene comes
// out identical to what it was.
//
// The film's timing follows the recording rather than the reverse: the new
// section is shorter, so the sections after it start earlier, and props.json's
// voice.track is rewritten from the measured mix.
//
// Usage:
//   node labs/freehand/scripts/resay-scene.mjs <labDir> <sceneIndex> [--apply]
//
// Without --apply this only self-checks: it re-mixes the UNCHANGED cuts and
// asserts the result reproduces the stored track. If that fails, the cutting is
// wrong and nothing should be written.
