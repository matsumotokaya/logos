// The whole film, end to end, on this machine: seed → narration → voice → MP4.
//
//   npm run event-cm:walkthrough
//
// TWO PROCESSES, and it has to be. `narration.ts` imports `server-only`, which
// throws unless Node runs with `--conditions=react-server`; Remotion's CJS
// entry cannot be loaded under that same condition. So this file stops at a
// props file and the npm script hands it to the Remotion CLI — the same CLI
// path `event:render` already uses, rather than a second renderer.
//
// A VERIFICATION TOOL, the same category as compare-art-directions.ts — not a
// second pipeline. Every decision is made by the product's own functions
// (`seedEventCmBrief`, `draftEventCmNarration`, `generateVoice`,
// `eventCmFilm`); the only thing this file does differently is put the bytes on
// disk instead of in R2. If it drifts from what the app produces, the wiring
// here is what is wrong.
//
// It exists because until now the template had only ever been looked at as
// stills. Stills cannot show whether the narration lands inside its scene,
// whether the voice and the timeline agree, or whether the music ducks — and
// those are the three things a viewer notices first.
//
// Costs money: one LLM call for the narration and one TTS pass per scene.
